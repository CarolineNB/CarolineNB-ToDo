# ToDo App

Implemented a ToDoApp using PostgresSQL backend database with a pyscopg2 database adapter to link Flask frontend. Used SQLAlchemy ORM to write and query Python objects to interact with database and AJAX to asynchronously update client side. Also utilized Flask-Alembic to manage version control of data schema and mitigate errors.
